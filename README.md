EMQX is the world's most scalable and reliable MQTT platform, designed for high-performance, reliable, and secure IoT data infrastructure. It supports MQTT 5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1, as well as other protocols like MQTT-SN, CoAP, LwM2M, and MQTT over QUIC. EMQX enables you to connect millions of IoT devices, process and route messages in real time, and integrate with a wide range of backend data systems. It's ideal for applications in AI, IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT), connected vehicles, smart cities, and beyond.

**Starting from v5.9.0, EMQX has unified all features from the previous Open Source and Enterprise editions into a single, powerful offering with the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1.**

If you want to understand why we made the change, please read this [blog post](https://www.emqx.com/en/news/emqx-adopts-business-source-license).

Please go to the [License](#License) section for more details about BSL 1.1.

- [1] Old limiter configs should be deleted from the config files (`etc/emqx.conf` and `data/configs/cluster-override.conf`) before upgrade.
- [2] Pre-5.4 routing table will be deleted. Upgrade to 5.9 first, then perform a full-cluster restart (not rolling) before upgrade to 5.10 or later.

## License

### Important License Update

Effective from version **5.9.0**, EMQX has transitioned from Apache 2.0 to the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1.

### License Requirement for Clustering (v5.9.0+)

Starting with EMQX v5.9.0, due to the license change and the unification of all features, deploying an EMQX cluster (more than 1 node) requires a license file to be loaded.

Please refer to the following resources for details on license acquisition, application, and the specifics of the BSL 1.1.
